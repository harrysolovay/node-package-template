## Node Package Template

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Core features:

- **Core Feature A** _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua._
- **Core Feature B** _Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat._
- **Core Feature C** _Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur._

How it compares to x:

- **It's smaller.** _It's 40x smaller._
- **It's faster.** _Componentize the problem of performance._
- **It's easier to learn.** _You already will have to know React Hooks & Context, just use them, they rock._
- **It's easier to integrate.** _Integrate one component at a time, and easily integrate with every React library._
- **It's easier to test.** _Testing reducers is a waste of your time, make it easier to test your React components._
- **It's easier to typecheck.** _Designed to make most of your types inferable._
- **It's minimal.** _It's just React._

## Install

Install with [npm](http://npmjs.org/)

```sh
npm install node-package-template
```

## TL;DR

```ts
import {nodePackageTemplate} from "node-package-template";
// (a: string, b: string) => void
```

The `nodePackageTemplate` export is a function which accepts two strings and does something with them.

```ts
nodePackageTemplate("hello", "world");
nodePackageTemplate("uncle", "snoopdog");
```

We can do another cool thing with this function.

```ts
nodePackageTemplate.cool("hello", "world");
nodePackageTemplate.cool("uncle", "snoopdog");
```

This enables something insane.

## Motivation

> You are now able to write WebAssembly, without learning a new language, and harness all these benefits WebAssembly might offer you. I think that is kind of powerful. [...] It [AssemblyScript] is absolutely usable, and very enjoyable! - Surma, [WebAssembly for Web Developers (Google I/O ’19)](https://youtu.be/njt-Qzw0mVY) (May 8th, 2019)

> AssemblyScript was frictionless. Not only does it allow you to use TypeScript to write WebAssembly, [...] it also produces glue-free WebAssembly modules that are very small with decent performance. – Surma, [Replacing a hot path in your app's JavaScript with WebAssembly](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/hotpath-with-wasm) (Feb 16, 2019)

> Perhaps the fundamental issue [to get a small .wasm file] is that JavaScript is the only language for which the Web runtime is a perfect fit. Close relatives that were designed to compile to it, like TypeScript, can be very efficient as well. But languages like C, C++, Rust, and so forth were not originally designed for that purpose. – Alon Zakai, [Small WebAssembly Binaries with Rust + Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/blog/binaryen/2018/04/18/rust-emscripten.html) (Apr 18, 2018)

> JavaScript's heyday as the only browser language is over, but most web developers are used to writing JavaScript, and learning a new syntax just to get access to WebAssembly is not (always) ideal. If only there was something in to bridge the gap… – Jani Tarvainen, [TypeScript is the bridge between JavaScript and WebAssembly](https://malloc.fi/typescript-bridge-javascript-webassembly) (Feb 20, 2018)

> I do think [compiling TypeScript into WASM] is tremendously useful. It allows JavaScript developers to create WASM modules without having to learn C. – Colin Eberhardt, [Exploring different approaches to building WebAssembly modules](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/10/17/wasm-mandelbrot.html) (Oct 17, 2017)
